Manish Regar - Official Profile
About Me
Hello, I’m Manish Regar, a 14-year-old tech enthusiast and ethical hacker born on February 12, 2011, hailing from Pune, Maharashtra, with roots in a small village in Rajasthan. Currently in Class 9, I’m passionate about using technology to make the internet safer and more accessible for everyone. My motto, "Honesty is the Best Policy", guides everything I do—from helping companies secure their systems to creating engaging content on my YouTube channel, ManishCountryBall.
As a self-taught hacker with a big heart, I specialize in identifying vulnerabilities like price glitches on e-commerce platforms, where users could exploit systems to purchase items at unfairly low prices. Instead of taking advantage, I notify companies about these issues and provide solutions to protect their businesses and customers. My work has helped businesses save money and maintain trust, proving that even a young person from a small village can make a global impact.
Beyond hacking, I’m a content creator who loves connecting with people worldwide through my YouTube channel and social media platforms. My journey is about blending tech skills, creativity, and honesty to inspire others and build a safer digital world. Whether I’m fixing bugs, building websites, or sharing fun stories, I’m driven by a desire to learn, grow, and make a difference.
